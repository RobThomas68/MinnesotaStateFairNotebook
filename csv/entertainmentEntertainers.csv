He got his first break when popular Chinese dance crew TFBoys used his song “Yoyo Tokyo.” Despite minimal clout at the time in his native Vancouver, that exposure enabled him to sell out back-to-back tours in China in 2017. In 2017 and 2018, he toured extensively in North America, Europe and Australia with his frequent collaborator Yung Gravy, first in support of their joint EP “Baby Gravy” and then for bbno$’s debut album, “bb steps.” bbno$’s musical output was (and is) prolific; during this era, he often released singles on a weekly basis, and he organically grew his audience until he crossed the threshold of 1 million Spotify monthly listeners in late 2018. In 2019, bbno$ self-released his sophomore album, “Recess,” and booked his first headlining American and European tours. In 2019, he released “Lalala,” a cheeky earworm of a rap single that nicely encapsulated his “ignorant but melodic” approach to hip-hop. “Lalala” erupted on a global scale and racked up 12 million streams within a couple of weeks. The following year, bbno$ became the 84th most-streamed artist in the world across genres on Spotify and received two JUNO Award nominations.
